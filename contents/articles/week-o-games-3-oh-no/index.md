I had about an hour yesterday to hammer out a game, so I sed a cheap burner idea I had floating about in my head. Games that are obnoxious in a kinda fun way appeal to me, so I was thinking about making a game where 6 people have to share a single controller (keyboard, in this case). I made a simple space shooter to demo the idea, but I didn't get to polishing it in the hour I had. The numbers need a lot of tweeking, but the main feature I would like to add is some powerups to throw some randomness into the game.

This week 'o games experiment hasn't quite panned out as I would like to, but not in a bad way. I was hoping to get an actual day to spend on each game, but I didn't really plan accoringly, as it was a pretty last minute idea so I couldn't just clear my schedule. I'm getting about 1-3 hours a day to spend per game, and it's a fun challenge, but it also seems to be more tiring than the average weekend project. I'll admit I slipped up a bit and after pumping out this game, I went straight to bed without even pushing my code or writing a scrap about it, and I'm cheating a bit now by writing this the morning after. It can't be perfect, but I got something done for the day, right? I'm getting a lot out of, but I need to be more dilligent about taking notes while I write. I have a list of bugs in the engine I have encountered so far, but I keep thinking of interesting snippets to include in a blog post that I keep forgetting when I actually sit down to write.

Here are some crappy notes I took about the development of this game:

"Skywriting" There was a point during testing where teh bullets were slow, and the ships moderately fast, and you could get some sky writing effects and cool spirals out of it. I thought it was cute! Didn't grab a screen cap of it though... Perhaps there is a second idea in there somewhere.

"Colliding groups" Maybe I should write a helper function that collides a sprite and a list or two lists and returns a list of offending parties instead of just true or false.

"Bullet hell" I have a quad tree in jam lying around somewhere, an end goal would be to port that code over to this game.

"Networking" This is actually unrealted to the multiplayer aspect of this game/unrelated to this game at all, but it's in my notes.

"Config files" I think this was just a comment that when I can massage my content that way, config files are pretty cool?

Anyhow, that's it for now.

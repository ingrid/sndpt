It was *really* nice out today. While I was walking back to my apartment with my partner, I kept commenting on all the spring flowers that are just now starting to pop up, and they suggest I make a game about honey bees pollinating flowers. I thoght it was a relly cute idea, and I sent some time today trying to proceedurally generate flowers/flower fields, but I ultimately decided to work on a differnt idea.

It's an idea I would certainly like to revisit, but it was a theme driven idea and for such a short time span, and with my (lack of) art skills, it didn't seem like there was enough time to dedicate to it. I decided to rehash an idea from 202X that I liked conceptually, but I didn't think we executed well.

I considred using ps for this project, as that was what the original concept was made for, and because a tile based system would make it dramatically easier to code, however, I ended up implementing ps-lite in jam instead. It was really fun to dig through my old code though. Ps was my first JS project, (also my first project I wrote on my current laptop...ah, old friend, we've been though some memorable times together...). I was a bit embarassed when I first thought about using it, but it' has aged better than I expected, and the code wasn't as terribly written as I thought it would be (though make no mistake, I would do a full rewrite now if I wanted to revisit it!).

Anyhow, as far as the actual idea I worked on for today, it was a laser board kinda game where you try to direct a laser into a goal. In our original draft of the idea there were some color splitting/blending elements that ended up being pretty poorly implemented the first time around. I also didn't get very far, I think mostly because I'm pretty mentally tired today. 4  1 day projects in a row seems to wear on you more than 1 four day project. Like I mentioned I implemented a psuedo ps-lite, then I kinda started on lasers and then I fell off because it was getting pretty late and I knew I wasn't going to finish the basics in time which was discouraging.

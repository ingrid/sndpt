I didn't think I would get anython don on the game effort today. I woke up and tried to run some errands this morning, but ended up in clerical error hell for several hours, and by the time things wrapped up, I had to head into the city for a class I help out with. I had no idea what game to make, so I was just about ready to give up, however, today in class one of my students who...sometimes isn't super excited about what we're learning...decided she wanted to make a flappy bird clone. I was pretty estatic sicne she was into the lesson for the day, but unfortunately there were a lot of technical issues (re: the internet was in and out and we were using cloud based tools).

It was pretty disheartning, but i was glad to see that she still wanted to work on the project through the end of class. I know someone who had previously taught toe same course for the same organization ended up dumping the original curcciulum (because he didn't like the tools they relied on) and taught straight html/css/js for developing web apps, so I was tempted to do the same in this scenario but unfortnately there are a lot of scheduling and time restraints this session that make it unlikely to work out. We still talked about it after class though, and perhaps they'll consider at least dumping the current tool kit.

Anyhow, once I finsihed with class, post class discussions, public transit, and dinner, it was past 9, but I figure I'd see what I could get done on a flappy bird clone by midnight. I'm calling it now (half til 12) because I'm hitting that not-productive tired stage, but I think I got an okay amount done in the few hours I had. One really obvious thing that is missing is collisions, but I was in the middle of writing the state wrapper and wanted to finish that before I added fail conditions. You can still play pretending that it's there, and just be honest when you bump a pipe...

Another thing that throws the whole experience off is that I've never actually played flappy bird, and I didn't really put much time into researching it as I just wanted to hammer out the core mechanics so I could have a roadmap in my head of how to help my student next class. I think I got the gist of the game, but the bits that actually make it really hard and fun (exact timing, speed, distances, etc) are all off.
